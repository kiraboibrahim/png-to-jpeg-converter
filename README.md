There isn't a one-size-fit image format. At times, you might want to covert between various image formats. Opting for an image format is more like buying a personal computer - you atleast have to consider your needs. Likewise, choosing PNG over JPEG or JPEG over PNG is subjective to the use case.

If you have PNG files occupying lots of space on your hard disk, converting them to JPEG can ensure efficient storage usage or for any other reason, for as long as it involves converting from PNG to JPEG, be my GUEST 🍵. This application will do the conversion for you 😃.
